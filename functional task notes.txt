create a function
call function
create recursive function
call recursive function
mapping function

implement a binary search function
something mathematical...

maybe write some ai to solve a problem
like a search or shortest path algorithm in a given domain

like:
there is a 2D world represented by coordinates.
on one of the coordinates is a goal.
write an algorithm for a robot placed on a coordinate that finds a path to the goal.
represent the path as a list of moves of the type "up", "down", "left" or "right" each representing the robot moving one in that direction
