create a class with specific properties
instantiate a couple of them
do something with an instance
do something on all instances
create a subclass or superclass

you want to create a system for managing stats and interactions between RPG characters with different classes.
Each character has:
-a name
-a character class
-a stat that represent their hit points
-one or more stats that represents offensive prowess
-one or more stats that represents defensive prowess
-optional class specific stats
-a method for attacking another character, which reduces their hit points by value related to the difference in character1's offense and character2's defense
-optional methods for class specific skills

here are some examples of characters:
name 	george		bob					john
class	warrior		mage					medic
hp	200		150					200
offense	50		100					30
defense	50		10					60
			mana = 100
skills:	attack		attack					attack
			Fireball - more damage but costs mana	mending - increases the hit points of a character

Create the system for these RPG characters with some character classes, some characters in this system and some code showing some interactions.

now we discover we also want a way to refresh characters to their original hit points, as well as preventing healing beyond this point.
To do this we need to also store a maximum hit points value for each character as well as a method for restoring a characters resources.
Some class specific resources might also need this to allow them to be replenished as well.
