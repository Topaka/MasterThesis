\section{Interview Setup}

\subsection{Observations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The use of Quorum as a programming language} - the majority of the participants (\#3, \#4, \#5, \#8) found Quorum an easy to use and understand language. Additionally, some compared it and found it similar to other languages such as C, C\#, Pascal and Python and generally less verbose than standard OO languages they had experience in(e.g. C\#,Java). 
\item \textbf{Managing scoping rules by the use of the end keyword instead of brackets} - 
\item \textbf{Quorum uses the colon (":") notation instead of dot(".")}
\item \textbf{The lack of common control statements such as for and for-each loops was confusing} - 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Interview questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What do you think about the language? Was it easy to learn?
\item Did you find some of the design odd?
\item How does Quorum relate to other languages you have experience in?
\item How did you find the tasks? Were they too challenging or too easy?
\item What do you think about coding without a compiler?
\end{enumerate}
