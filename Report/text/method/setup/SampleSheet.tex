\section{Samples}
The idea behind the sample sheet was to provide examples of code that the participant could use to learn what was necessary from the language in order to solve the tasks.
Working samples of code were used since it tends to give a more wholesome picture of how the code should look, without resorting to detailed description of how everything works.
The samples often included smaller details, not specifically relevant for what was explained at the time in order to cut down on the number of samples needed.
An example of this is the \lstinline!Paws()! method in the classes sample being used to demonstrate returning values from methods.
The constructors in Quorum were omitted from the samples as they are optional and their functionality does not support using parameters which is what most of our participants would consider the purpose of constructors.
The sample sheet can be found in \appref{chapter:sampleSheet}.
