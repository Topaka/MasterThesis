\section{Participants sample}
\label{section:Participant sample}
All the participants taking part in the usability evaluation and the evaluation method were experienced programmers. They all had very similar age and occupation - Computer science students from the 4th semester and up, with programming experience in C and C\# as well as other programming languages ( e.g. Java, F\#, Python, Pascal).

We had six participants taking part in the main experiment, who are numbered participant \#3 to participant \#8.
Participant \#1 was the pilot test participant we used to improve our setup before the first test.
Participant \#2 has been omitted from all the direct evaluation results as he was not an experienced programmer and therefore does not fit the target group of the experiment.
We have kept his data, however, as it shows some interesting pointers for problems encountered by novice programmers.
