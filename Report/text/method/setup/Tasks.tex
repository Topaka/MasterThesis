\section{Tasks}
The idea of creating a tasks sheet was to create tasks that would explore various features of the language being tested. Although each task had an intended purpose with a clear goal, their design allows more than one possible solution which gave the participants the freedom to experiment with the language.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first task had the intended purpose of testing arithmetic expressions and the use of data types.
\item The second task had the purpose of testing containers in the language (such as arrays) and control structures.
It also tested responsible code modification since there was a certain degree of intended repetitiveness in the subtasks which warranted careful reusing of code segments .%might not be good to point out
\item The third task was for testing the concept of classes and inheritance. The design of this task was inspired by the task used in the C\# section of our usability experiment in section \ref{subsection:C Task}.
\item The final task was testing operations on strings, including the exercise of in-build actions specifically useful for splitting text segments.
\end{itemize}
