\section{Interview Results}
During the interview we collected a lot of feedback. The most common observations were:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The use of Quorum as a programming language} - the majority of the participants (\#3, \#4, \#5, \#8) found Quorum an easy to use and understand language. Additionally, some compared it and found it similar to other languages such as C, C\#, Pascal and Python and generally less verbose than standard OO languages they had experience with (e.g. C\#,Java). 
\item \textbf{Managing scoping rules by the use of the end keyword instead of brackets} - Generally, most of the participants found the use of the end keyword for defining scopes very confusing. Participants \#4 and \#6 preferred the use of brackets, similar to OO languages they were familiar with (e.g. Java and C\#), while participants \#7 and \#8 preferred indentation similar to languages like Python. Participant \#7 further suggested to extend the end construct to begin-end, similar to Pascal which would make the language more user-friendly for novices. 
\item \textbf{Quorum uses the colon (":") notation instead of dot(".")} - Given their prior experience with programming languages where the dot (".") notation is common, participants \#4, \#6 and \#7 found it confusing to use the  colon (":") notation instead. This confusion was further reinforced by the fact that the colon could be used in different scenarios yet the dot notation is still used when calling libraries.
\item \textbf{The lack of common control statements such as for and for-each loops was confusing} - The lack of common control statements such as for or for-each loops in Quorum seemed like a hurdle for the participants and consequently they found it not so intuitive to use the repeat while construct as a substitute of that. This is evident by the fact that some of them completely forgot to include it in the loop's signature (participant \#3) or found it unnecessary altogether (participant \#7).
