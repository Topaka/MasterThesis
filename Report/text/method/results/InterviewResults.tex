\section{Interview Results}
During the interview we collected a lot of feedback. The most common observations were:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The use of Quorum as a programming language} - the majority of the participants (\#3, \#4, \#5, \#8) found Quorum an easy to use and understand language. Additionally, some compared it and found it similar to other languages such as C, C\#, Pascal and Python and generally less verbose than standard OO languages they had experience in(e.g. C\#,Java). 
\item \textbf{Managing scoping rules by the use of the end keyword instead of brackets} - 
\item \textbf{Quorum uses the colon (":") notation instead of dot(".")}
\item \textbf{The lack of common control statements such as for and for-each loops was confusing} - 
\end{itemize}
