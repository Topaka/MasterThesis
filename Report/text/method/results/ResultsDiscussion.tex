\chapter{Results}
\label{chapter:Results}

This section will highlight the results from the evaluation method and a discussion of how the data can serve as a future reference to language designers and people interested in conducting their own evaluation methods. Initially, we conducted a pilot test with one participant in order to test the overall setup of the experiment and get some pointers of what areas could be further improved. Similarly to how the results were evaluated in Chapter \ref{chapter:ExperimenteEvaluation}, we made use of the IDA method \cite{IDA} to categorize the problems we identified based on their importance and severity.

\section{Problems categorization}
The premise of the experiment is to try to divide the IDE from the language which does not warrant using a compiler.
However, since this means the system cannot give any feedback, the usual rules for categorisation can not apply.
For this reason, we would try to reason where each problem should be and would it make a difference given that a compiler have been used instead.
The general guidelines we have used for this categorisation are:
\begin{description}
\item[Cosmetic problems] are typos and small keyword and character differences that can easily be fixed by replacing the wrong part.
\item[Serious problems] are structural errors that usually impacts how the code is structured, but is usually small enough that it can be fixed with a few changes.
\item[Critical problems] are fundamental misunderstandings of how the language structures code and large structural errors that would require a revision of the algorithm.

\caption{The table of identified problems categorised by severity}
\end{table}

\textbf{Critical problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Not using the “end” keyword at all} - this would affect the overall validity of the program because the scoping rules in Quorum are defined in conjunction with the “end” keyword. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how scoping works in the language
\item \textbf{The lack of constructors in Quorum} - Quorum does not support constructors which might problematic for the participants, having experience with other languages where this feature is mandatory. It both causes the participants to invoke syntax in the class that is not supported, and have difficulties instantiating classes. Since this is a significant difference in how the code should be structured, it is considered critical.
\item \textbf{Misunderstanding the effect of Sort() on arrays of objects} - The inbuilt Sort function for arrays does not have access to the properties of the objects and therefore does not sort them by any of those. This would have the consequence of code, written with the assumption that it works, be most likely wrong, which means recovery would require a full rewrite of the algorithm. This makes the problem critical. It is possible that with the use of a compiler the participant would discover and recover much easier, which could mean the problem would potentially be considered serious.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Serious problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Not using the “end” keyword to end the scope of if-statements} - Although this problem looks similar to the first problem defined in Critical problems, the difference is that it is more likely to be an overlook than a misunderstanding of the scoping rules in Quorum. Also single-line if-statements might be present in other languages and not in Quorum.
\item \textbf{Forgetting to increment the iterator in a repeat while loop} - This could be considered an oversight on the participant’s part, attributed to how the repeat-while construct works in Quorum compared to how usually for-loops are used, and therefore it was not critical. However, it is still considered a serious problem because of the impact it has on the structural correctness of the code.
\item \textbf{The lack of common looping constructs (for-loops or foreach loops)} - This is considered a serious problem for few reasons. Firstly, it warrants the use of the repeat-while construct as a part of Quorum, which might not be so intuitive for people coming with backgrounds in other languages, where these constructs are present. Secondly, this might compound to the previous problem described in this section which would have a high impact on the validity of the written program. 
\item \textbf{Forgetting to import a library for containers (array)} - Containers in Quorum, and specifically arrays, have to imported first before being used. This is considered a serious problem since it might have a high impact on the validity of the program. 
\item \textbf{Not using “elseif” to avoid having to close an additional scope} - This problem is serious because it shows a lack of understanding the finer points of scoping in an if-else chain. Problematic since “else if” is also valid syntax, but carries unintended consequences.
\item \textbf{Not resetting inner loop iterator between loops} - Similarly to serious problem 2, this could be considered an oversight on the participant’s end due to previous experience with other programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Cosmetic problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Using colon (“:”) instead of dot (“.”)} - This is considered a cosmetic problem since does not affect the structure of the program being only an exchange of a single character. It could be said that most of the participants had a programming bias given their background in other programming languages where the dot notation is common.
\item \textbf{The lack of aggregate operators in Quorum (e.g.“+=”)} - This is considered a cosmetic problem since it does not affect the correctness of the program but it is rather a matter of convenience for the participants.
\item \textbf{Using conditional AND and OR as “\&\&” and “||” instead of “and” and “or” keywords, as defined in Quorum}  - This problem is considered cosmetic because the participants did not use the correct keywords in the context but had the proper intentions to do so. This could be attributed to the simple matter of not properly reading the sample sheet to find the proper keywords and using the ones they know from other languages instead.
\item \textbf{Using the “float” instead of “number” keyword} - This is considered a cosmetic problem because it does not have a big impact on the program’s correctness but rather is using a naming convention from other programming languages
\item \textbf{Using “string” instead of the “text” keyword} - this is the same as with the previous cosmetic problem
\item \textbf{Writing “output” instead of “return” as the keyword for a return statement} - This is cosmetic because it is mostly a result of our sample sheet using “output” often, while the participants were more commonly expected to write code returning something and had a familiarity with the “return” keyword from other languages.
\item \textbf{Using “==” in conditional statements instead of “=”} - Similarly to previous cosmetic problems, the main reason behind this problem is that most of the participants had experience with other programming languages where the “==” notation is common and in turn had a particular bias against using the “=” notation.
\item \textbf{Using “int” instead of “integer”}  - same as with cosmetic problem 4
\item \textbf{Using “bool” instead of “boolean”} - same as with cosmetic problem 4
\item \textbf{Typos in library importing} - This is a simple case of having small typos when writing the import code. Easily fixed and a cosmetic problem.
\item \textbf{Mistyping “integer” as “integar”}  - this is a cosmetic problem since it is a simple typing mistake and it does not have any impact on the validity of the program.
\item \textbf{ Accidentally used 0 instead of O in variable name}  - Again another small typo and therefore cosmetic.
\item \textbf{Mistyped the “is” keyword as “ia”}  - similar to cosmetic problem 12
\item \textbf{Forgot to add the “repeat” keyword} - This problem is considered cosmetic since it does not have a significant impact on the correctness of the program.
