\section{Interview Suggestions}
During the interview we collected several suggestions as to what could be done to improve the experiment.
These suggestions have been described here.

\begin{description}
\item[Providing a skeleton for the task solutions] One of the suggestions was, to add some code on the code sheet that would show the skeleton of the expected solution. The participant would then only have to worry about filling in the code for the functionality rather than how the solution should be structured.
\item[Adding a cheat sheet to the sample sheet] Another suggestions was to add an extra sheet to the sample sheet, that would contain just a list of all the keywords and constructs, to have a single page to look at when looking for a specific thing.
\item[Using separate pages for each task] A third suggestion was to have each task on a separate page, which would allow addition of some samples specific to that task on the page. In essence by having a smaller subset of the samples for each task, the amount of sample code to look through at any time would be reduced.
