Programming languages have been used for years but still there has not been established a robust and efficient way to asses and evaluate them. However, plenty of research has been done on the topic and this chapter explores some of it.

M. Farooq et al. 2014 \todo{ref needed}, wrote a paper introducing an evaluation framework which provides a comparative analysis of widely used first programming languages (FPLs), or namely languages which are used as a first language for teaching introductory programming. The framework was based on technical and environmental features and it was used for testing the suitability of existing imperative and object oriented languages as an appropriate FPL. In order to support their framework, they came up with a customizable scoring function for computing a quantitative suitability score for a given language. Lastly, they evaluated the most widely used FPLs by computing their suitability scores.
