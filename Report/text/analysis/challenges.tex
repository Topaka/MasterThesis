Conducting empirical studies in order to prove the validity of a hypothesis usually involves a certain amount of human resources. For studies and experiments having a qualitative nature this number is in the tens or hundreds, and for ones having a quantitative nature - in the thousands. Gathering data, even from a small number of people is a daunting task and takes considerable resources and time. Additionally, the problem arises of trying to have a participants sample with diverse backgrounds (age, occupation, experience etc.) in order to address a wider population, which adds an additional layer of complexity.
