In methods for programming language design evaluation there is a gap between small internal methods and large scale surveys and studies.
A similar gap in HCI has been filled by the discount usability evaluation method.
In this report, the discount usability methods applicability on programming languages was examined, and it was found usable but better suited for compiler and IDE evaluation over language design evaluation.
To create a method to fill the gap, a modified version of the usability method, where the IDE and compiler was removed, was tested.
