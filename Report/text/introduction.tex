Computer programming has increasing relevance to today's advancement of technologies. Therefore, existing and established programming languages are constantly improved and new ones are created to meet that demand. The languages which are considered most suitable for introductory programming, are being adopted by educational institutions as part of their computer science curriculum e.g. Java, Python and more recently, Scratch \todo{Maybe a reference(s) is needed here} . Similarly, some languages are considered arguably better than others in their intended purpose in the software industry. However, formal evaluation methods for assessing programming languages are very few and limited in their use and most evidence gathered to support such claims are anecdotal in nature.
