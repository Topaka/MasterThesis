\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
In this report, we wanted to explore whether HCI techniques could be applicable for the evaluation of programming languages.
We briefly described existing evaluation methods for programming languages and how they differ, along their strengths and weaknesses, which helped us get a better understanding of the design of such methods.
In the context of HCI techniques, we have examined the usefulness of the discount usability method with the IDA method for data analysis on C\# and F\#.
In this examination we found that the discount usability method can be used to evaluate programming languages, but has some shortcomings.
The programming language’s IDE has a large effect on the results, often providing significant assistance which effectively eliminates many of the errors which might otherwise get caught in the language.
Based on the results, we believe that the discount usability method is good for testing a compiler and an IDE, but is less well suited for examining language design.

To create a method better suited for evaluating language design, we conducted an adapted usability experiment where we specifically avoided the use of an IDE or a compiler.
An added advantage of such a method is that it does not require the creation of any tools for the language before the language design can be tested, making it a low-cost and efficient solution. 
For this experiment we used the evidence-based language Quorum, as it is less likely for our participant group to be familiar with it, yet it is in programming paradigm they are familiar with. 

During the analysis process we had to alter the criteria used for categorising the problems - from time spent on a problem to severity of fixing the problem.
This was due to the discovery that since the system does not have a way of giving meaningful feedback to the participant, the participants would not encounter problems nor spend time fixing them.

Comparing the resulting data from the method with Quorum’s evidence showed us that most of data was comparable though not strictly in agreement.
However, Quorum’s data was mostly centered around syntax choice and therefore was mostly only related to the cosmetic problems, which are the least interesting problems to consider.
The data suggests that our method will be better suited for getting some of the deeper problems with a programming language when compared to the syntax questionnaires used as evidence for Quorum.
